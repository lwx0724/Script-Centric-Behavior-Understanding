Some rules of judgment are as follows:

2. Please pay more attention to the child's emotions and the time lag between the child's response after the doctor's instruction. 
3. If a child has more than two symptoms, he can be judged to have ASD. 
4. As TD children also occasionally fail to respond to instructions, please pay more attention to children's best one response in multiple paradigms. 
5. In the end, Please judge whether the child is ASD or TD based on the content of the video, 1 means ASD, 0 means TD, and you can only answer 0 or 1 and please give the reason for the judgement.
