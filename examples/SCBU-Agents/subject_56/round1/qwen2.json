    "content": "1. Reasons for autism spectrum disorder judgment: The child exhibits several behaviors that are concerning for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). There are significant deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, as evidenced by the lack of social smiling in response to the doctor's and parent's attempts to engage the child with smiles and praise (03:33.125, 04:44.375, 09:32.875). The child also shows deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors, such as not pointing to the picture of the tree when prompted (12:29.375) and not showing joint attention or interest when the doctor pointed to the clock and asked about the time (17:05.250). Additionally, the child's failure to react to the parent's departure and the lack of seeking comfort or showing distress during the Separation Anxiety paradigm (22:47.125, 24:25.375) indicate possible deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships. While the child does show some typical responses, such as turning towards the doctor when her name is called (01:04.250, 02:17.250) and pointing out the location of the flower and sofa pictures (11:15.875, 15:41.500), the pattern of deficits in social interaction and communication is concerning.\n\n2. Autism spectrum disorder Judgment results: 1\n\n3. Persuasion: \n- <doctor 4> to <doctor 2>: While the child does show some typical responses, such as turning towards the doctor when her name is called and pointing out the location of the flower and sofa pictures, these are not consistent across all interactions. For example, the child does not respond to the balloon (14:17.250) and has difficulty locating the clock (17:05.250). Additionally, the lack of social smiling (03:33.125, 04:44.375, 09:32.875) and the absence of separation anxiety (22:47.125, 24:25.375) are significant red flags for ASD. These behaviors suggest a pattern of social and communicative deficits that are more consistent with ASD than typical development.\n- <doctor 4> to <doctor 3>: While the child does show some typical behaviors, such as turning towards the doctor when her name is called and pointing out the location of the flower and sofa pictures, the lack of social smiling (03:33.125, 04:44.375, 09:32.875) and the absence of separation anxiety (22:47.125, 24:25.375) are concerning. These behaviors, along with the inconsistent responses to joint attention tasks, suggest a pattern of social and communicative deficits that align more closely with ASD criteria.",
