Reasons for autism spectrum disorder judgment: Upon reviewing the script and considering the diagnostic results from other experts, it is evident that the child displays a mix of behaviors that are both consistent and inconsistent with ASD. The child does respond to their name being called and makes eye contact, which are not typical ASD behaviors. However, there are also significant deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, as the child rarely smiles in response to social interactions and shows limited sharing of enjoyment or achievements. The child's response to the parent's departure is also noteworthy; the lack of reaction or distress could indicate a deficit in understanding relationships or emotional attachment. Additionally, while the child does point to indicated objects, there is inconsistency in this behavior, and the child does not always maintain joint attention or show interest in shared experiences, which are key aspects of social communication. These mixed findings suggest that while the child does not present with a clear-cut case of ASD, there are enough social and communicative deficits to warrant further assessment and consideration of ASD.\n\n2. Autism spectrum disorder Judgment results: [1]\n\n3. Persuasion: \n<doctor 3 to doctor 2>: While the child does exhibit some behaviors that are not consistent with ASD, such as responding to their name and making eye contact, the overall pattern of behavior, including the lack of social smiling, limited sharing of enjoyment, and the absence of distress when the parent leaves, suggests that the child may indeed be on the autism spectrum. These behaviors align with the social and communicative deficits that are characteristic of ASD and should not be overlooked. The child's inconsistent responses to social cues and the lack of a typical emotional response to separation from a caregiver are significant and warrant further consideration of ASD."
