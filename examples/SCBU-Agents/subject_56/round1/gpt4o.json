There are notable deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, such as the lack of smiling response during social smile paradigms, and limited eye contact. The child shows inconsistent responses to their name and instructions, indicating deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors. There is difficulty in initiating and maintaining joint attention, as seen in the child's limited reactions during the Indicating Gesture and Joint Attention paradigms. The child also demonstrates reduced separation anxiety, showing no response when the parent leaves the room, which is atypical for a child of this age and suggests a deficit in developing and maintaining relationships. However, the child does show some typical responses, such as turning towards the doctor when their name is called and pointing out the location of the flower and sofa pictures, which are inconsistent with ASD. Despite these typical behaviors, the pattern of deficits in social interaction and communication is concerning.]\n\n2. Autism spectrum disorder Judgment results: [1]\n\n3. Persuasion: [<doctor 1> to <doctor 2>: While the child does exhibit some typical behaviors, such as responding to their name and making eye contact, these are inconsistent and not sustained throughout the interaction. The lack of social smiling, inconsistent joint attention, and reduced separation anxiety are significant indicators of ASD. The child's behavior during the Indicating Gesture and Joint Attention paradigms, where they fail to consistently respond or share attention, further supports the ASD diagnosis. These deficits in social-emotional reciprocity and nonverbal communication are critical in diagnosing ASD, despite the presence of some typical behaviors.]",
