Reasons for autism spectrum disorder judgment: [While the child demonstrates some typical behaviors, there are consistent patterns that align with ASD criteria. The child shows deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, particularly in the lack of social smiling across multiple paradigms (03:33.125, 04:44.375, 09:32.875). Although the child makes eye contact, the absence of smiling suggests atypical social engagement. The child's response to joint attention and indicating gestures is inconsistent, with strong performances in some trials (11:15.875, 15:41.500) but poor responses in others (14:17.250, 17:05.250). The lack of separation anxiety (22:47.125, 24:25.375) is atypical for a child of this age and suggests difficulties in emotional bonding. While the child does show some strengths in social communication, the persistent deficits in social-emotional reciprocity and inconsistent joint attention skills align more closely with ASD criteria.]\n\n2. Autism spectrum disorder Judgment results: [1]\n\n3. Persuasion: [<doctor 2> to <doctor 1>: While I initially disagreed with your assessment, upon further review of the <Script>, I now concur with your diagnosis. The child's consistent lack of social smiling, despite making eye contact, is a significant indicator of deficits in social-emotional reciprocity. For instance, at 03:33.125, 04:44.375, and 09:32.875, the child looks at the doctor but doesn't smile, even when praised or engaged with warmth. This pattern persists across multiple social interactions, suggesting a core deficit in social engagement typical of ASD. Additionally, the child's inconsistent performance in joint attention tasks, particularly the failure to respond to the balloon picture (14:17.250) and difficulty locating the clock (17:05.250), aligns with your observation of deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors. The lack of separation anxiety (22:47.125, 24:25.375) further supports your assessment of difficulties in developing and maintaining relationships. While the child does show some typical behaviors, the overall pattern of social-communication deficits is more consistent with ASD than typical development.]"
