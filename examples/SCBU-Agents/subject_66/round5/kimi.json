The child's behavior exhibits several key indicators consistent with ASD, including deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, as evidenced by the lack of social smiling despite making eye contact during the Social Smile paradigms. The child's inconsistent response to their name, with a normal response only when the doctor called the child's name, suggests potential social communication deficits. The child's focused play on the toy car and limited reaction to sensory stimuli indicate possible restricted and repetitive behaviors. While the child did show some joint attention by pointing to the pictures and sharing findings, these were not consistent across all paradigms. The child's reaction to the parent leaving the room was appropriate, which is a positive sign. However, the overall pattern of behavior, with deficits in social reciprocity and inconsistent responses to social cues, aligns with some criteria for ASD. The child's behavior does not fully meet the criteria for a definitive diagnosis of ASD, but the presence of several ASD-consistent behaviors warrants a cautious approach.]\n\n2. Autism spectrum disorder Judgment results: [1]\n\n3. Persuasion: [<doctor 3> to <doctor 2>: The child's lack of social smiling across multiple attempts, despite making eye contact, is a significant red flag for ASD, as it indicates a deficit in social-emotional reciprocity. This behavior is consistent with the diagnostic criteria for ASD, as highlighted by <doctor 1> and <doctor 4>. Additionally, the child's inconsistent response to their name and limited reaction to sensory stimuli further support the diagnosis of ASD, as pointed out by <doctor 5>. These behaviors are not easily explained by typical development variations and are more aligned with the atypical social and communication patterns seen in ASD.]"
