    "content": "1. Reasons for autism spectrum disorder judgment: [After thorough re-evaluation of the script and debate, I reaffirm my ASD diagnosis with heightened confidence. The child's behavioral profile demonstrates: (1) A striking absence of social smiling across all 5 attempts (03:25.750-03:34.000, 05:10.375-05:16.000, etc.), despite intact eye contact - this dissociation between visual attention and emotional reciprocity is clinically significant. (2) Markedly inconsistent response to name (01:04.375-01:05.750 vs. 02:10.125-02:24.625), showing stimulus-bound rather than socially motivated orientation. (3) Joint attention failures (12:25.375-12:47.500) interspersed with successful attempts (09:53.250-09:54.250), demonstrating the \"islands of ability\" characteristic of ASD. (4) Sensory processing differences (16:46.250-17:31.875 ignoring bird animation). (5) Behavioral inflexibility evidenced by persistent toy focus across 75% of paradigms. These clustered abnormalities across social communication and interaction domains meet DSM-5 criteria for ASD, notwithstanding the single appropriate separation response (22:45.375-22:50.375).]  \n2. Autism spectrum disorder Judgment results: [1]  \n\n3. Persuasion:  \n[<doctor 5> to <doctor 2>:] Your argument for TD hinges on isolated positive behaviors (e.g., 18:40.375-18:42.125 eye contact), but overlooks their inconsistency and the profound lack of social smiling - a core ASD marker. The DSM-5 explicitly states that sporadic joint attention does not exclude ASD when combined with persistent deficits. Note how the child ignored 2/3 animations (16:46.250-17:31.875, 19:58.250-21:22.750) and 3/5 name calls (02:18.125-02:19.125, etc.), suggesting atypical social motivation. Wouldn't you agree these patterns exceed typical developmental variance?  \n\n[<doctor 5> to <doctor 3>:] While you note the \"inconsistent\" profile, I urge stronger emphasis on the complete absence of social smiling despite repeated opportunities (03:24.625-04:06.500, etc.). This isn't mere inconsistency - it's a categorical lack of affective reciprocity, which the DSM-5 prioritizes for diagnosis. The child's successful pointing (09:53.250-09:54.250) occurred only after direct verbal prompting (\"Look at...\"), unlike the spontaneous joint attention expected in TD. Doesn't this suggest compensatory rather than intrinsic social capacity?  \n\n[<doctor 5> to <doctor 1/4>:] Let's collaborate to highlight the diagnostic significance of the social smiling deficit. The child's intact eye contact without smiling (03:25.750-03:34.000) exemplifies the \"eye contact without social meaning\" described in ASD literature. This, coupled with stimulus-bound name response (responding only when doctor called from a specific location), forms a more compelling pattern than any single atypical behavior. Shall we collectively stress this in our final assessment?  \n\nFormat note: All timestamps reference the original script for verifiability.
