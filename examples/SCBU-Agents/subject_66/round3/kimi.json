Reasons for autism spectrum disorder judgment: [Upon careful review of the script and considering the debate, I find that the child exhibits a mix of behaviors that are both typical and atypical. The child's lack of social smiling in response to the doctor's and parent's smiles, despite making eye contact, is a significant red flag. The inconsistent response to the name being called, with a normal response only when the doctor called the child's name, suggests potential social communication deficits. The child's focused play on the toy car and limited reaction to sensory stimuli indicate possible restricted and repetitive behaviors. While the child did show some joint attention by pointing to the pictures and sharing findings, these were not consistent across all paradigms. The child's reaction to the parent leaving the room was appropriate, which is a positive sign. However, the overall pattern of behavior, with deficits in social reciprocity and inconsistent responses to social cues, aligns with some criteria for ASD. The child's behavior does not fully meet the criteria for a definitive diagnosis of ASD, but the presence of several ASD-consistent behaviors warrants a cautious approach.]\n\n2. Autism spectrum disorder Judgment results: [1]\n\n3. Persuasion: [<doctor 3> to <doctor 2>: The child's lack of social smiling and inconsistent response to name-calling are significant indicators of potential ASD, as highlighted by other experts. While the child does exhibit some typical behaviors, the clustering of atypical behaviors across multiple paradigms aligns with the DSM-5 criteria for ASD. The child's focused play on the toy car and limited reaction to sensory stimuli suggest restricted and repetitive behaviors, which are also part of the ASD criteria.] [<doctor 3> to <doctor 4>: I agree with the mixed presentation of behaviors, but the persistent lack of social smiling and inconsistent response to name calling are significant indicators of potential ASD. The child's limited response to sensory stimuli and focused play on the toy car further support the consideration of ASD.]"
