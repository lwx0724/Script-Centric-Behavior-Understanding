    "content": "1. Reasons for autism spectrum disorder judgment: [The child demonstrates a mix of typical and atypical behaviors, which makes the diagnosis challenging. However, several key behaviors align with the DSM-5 criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The child shows significant deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, particularly the lack of social smiling despite making eye contact during multiple Social Smile paradigms. This is a critical indicator of atypical social interaction. The child also exhibits inconsistent responses to name calling, responding appropriately only once when the doctor called the child's name but not when the parent called. This inconsistency in response to social cues is another significant indicator of potential ASD. The child's persistent focus on the toy car and limited reaction to sensory stimuli, such as animations and sounds, further support the consideration of ASD. While the child did show some joint attention by pointing to objects and sharing findings with the doctor, these behaviors were not consistent across all paradigms. The clustering of these atypical behaviors across multiple domains, particularly the lack of social smiling and inconsistent response to name calling, aligns with the DSM-5 criteria for ASD.]\n\n2.

This behavior is consistent across multiple Social Smile paradigms, indicating a deficit in social-emotional reciprocity. Additionally, the child's inconsistent response to name calling, particularly the lack of response to the parent, suggests atypical social responsiveness. While the child did show some joint attention and shared findings, these behaviors were not consistent across all paradigms.
