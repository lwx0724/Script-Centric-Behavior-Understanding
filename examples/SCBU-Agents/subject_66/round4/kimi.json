The child's lack of social smiling despite making eye contact during the Social Smile paradigms is a significant red flag, indicating deficits in social-emotional reciprocity. The inconsistent response to the child's name, with a normal response only when the doctor called the child's name, suggests potential social communication deficits. The child's focused play on the toy car and limited reaction to sensory stimuli indicate possible restricted and repetitive behaviors. While the child did show some joint attention by pointing to the pictures and sharing findings, these were not consistent across all paradigms. The child's reaction to the parent leaving the room was appropriate, which is a positive sign. However, the overall pattern of behavior, with deficits in social reciprocity and inconsistent responses to social cues, aligns with some criteria for ASD. The child's behavior does not fully meet the criteria for a definitive diagnosis of ASD, but the presence of several ASD-consistent behaviors warrants a cautious approach.]\n\n2. Autism spectrum disorder Judgment results: [1]\n\n3. Persuasion: [<doctor 3> to <doctor 2>: The child's lack of social smiling and inconsistent response to name-calling are significant indicators of ASD, as highlighted by other experts. While the child did exhibit some typical behaviors, the clustering of atypical behaviors across multiple domains aligns with the DSM-5 criteria for ASD. The child's persistent focus on the toy car and limited reaction to sensory stimuli further support the consideration of ASD.] [<doctor 3> to <doctor 4>: I agree with your assessment that the child demonstrates a mix of typical and atypical behaviors. However, the key behaviors that align with the DSM-5 criteria for ASD, such as the lack of social smiling and inconsistent response to name calling, are critical indicators that should not be overlooked. The child's behavior pattern suggests a broader pattern consistent with ASD, even if not all criteria are met definitively.] [<doctor 3> to <doctor 5>: Your detailed analysis of the child's behavior aligns with my own observations. The child's clinical significant social communication deficits, joint attention abnormalities, sensory processing differences, and behavioral inflexibility are all consistent with ASD. The inconsistent social responses and context-dependent behaviors are characteristic of ASD, as noted in the DSM-5.]"
