The child exhibits several behaviors consistent with ASD, including deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, as evidenced by the lack of social smiling despite making eye contact during the Social Smile paradigms. The child also shows inconsistent responses to social cues, such as not responding to their name in multiple instances and not consistently engaging in joint attention. While the child did demonstrate some joint attention behaviors, such as pointing and sharing findings, these were not consistent across all paradigms. The child's persistent focus on the toy car and limited response to sensory stimuli, such as animations and sounds, further suggest atypical sensory processing. The child's reaction to separation anxiety was appropriate, indicating some typical social behavior. However, the overall pattern of behaviors observed suggests a broader pattern consistent with ASD. The inconsistency in social responsiveness, particularly the lack of social smiling and the failure to respond to name-calling, are significant indicators of ASD.]\n 2. Autism spectrum disorder Judgment results: [1]\n 3. Persuasion: [<doctor 1> to <doctor 2>: While I acknowledge the presence of some typical behaviors, such as appropriate separation anxiety and occasional joint attention, the overall pattern of inconsistent social responses, lack of social smiling, and limited engagement with social cues aligns more closely with ASD. The child's failure to respond to their name in multiple instances and the lack of consistent social-emotional reciprocity are significant indicators of ASD. The DSM-5 criteria for ASD include deficits in social communication and interaction, which are evident in this child's behavior. The child's persistent focus on the toy car and limited response to sensory stimuli further support the diagnosis. The presence of some typical behaviors does not negate the overall pattern of atypical behaviors that align with ASD criteria.] '''",
