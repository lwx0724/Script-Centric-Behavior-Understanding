There are notable deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, as evidenced by the lack of social smiling despite making eye contact during the Social Smile paradigms. The child also shows inconsistent responses to social cues, such as not responding to their name in multiple instances and not consistently engaging in joint attention. While the child did demonstrate some joint attention behaviors, such as pointing and sharing findings, these were not consistent across all paradigms. The child's persistent focus on the toy car and limited response to sensory stimuli, such as animations and sounds, further suggest atypical sensory processing. The child's reaction to separation anxiety was appropriate, indicating some typical social behavior. However, the overall pattern of behaviors observed suggests a broader pattern consistent with ASD.]\n\n2. Autism spectrum disorder Judgment results: [1]\n\n3. Persuasion: [<doctor 1> to <doctor 2>: While the child did show some typical behaviors, such as appropriate separation anxiety and occasional joint attention, the overall pattern of inconsistent social responses, lack of social smiling, and limited engagement with social cues aligns more closely with ASD. The child's failure to respond to their name in multiple instances and the lack of consistent social-emotional reciprocity are significant indicators of ASD. <doctor 1> to <doctor 3>: Although the child did engage in some joint attention activities, the lack of social smiling and the persistent focus on the toy car suggest deficits in social-emotional reciprocity and insistence on sameness, which are consistent with ASD. The child's behaviors across multiple paradigms indicate a broader pattern of atypical social interaction. <doctor 1> to <doctor 4>: While the child did exhibit some typical behaviors, such as pointing and reacting to the parent's departure, the overall pattern of inconsistent social responses, lack of social smiling, and limited engagement with social cues aligns more closely with ASD. The child's failure to respond to their name in multiple instances and the lack of consistent social-emotional reciprocity are significant indicators of ASD.]",
