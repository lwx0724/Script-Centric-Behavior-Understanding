    "content": "1. Reasons for autism spectrum disorder judgment: [After reviewing the script and considering colleagues' perspectives, I maintain my ASD diagnosis (1) but with refined rationale. The child shows a clear pattern of: (1) Social-emotional reciprocity deficits (0/5 social smile responses despite alert eye contact; 2/3 name response failures with parents vs. 1/1 success with doctor suggests contextual inconsistency), (2) Nonverbal communication abnormalities (delayed/absent pointing in 3/6 joint attention trials, with successful attempts occurring only after prolonged engagement), and (3) Sensory processing differences (ignoring 2/3 sudden audiovisual stimuli). While some typical behaviors exist (separation anxiety, occasional joint attention), the clustering of atypical behaviors across multiple paradigms meets DSM-5 criteria for ASD. The inconsistency itself is diagnostically significant - neurotypical children typically show more uniform social responsiveness.]\n\n2. Autism spectrum disorder Judgment results: [1]\n\n3. Persuasion: \n[<doctor 5> to <doctor 2>: Your observation of \"mixed presentation\" actually supports ASD diagnosis. DSM-5 explicitly notes that symptoms may fluctuate with situational demands. The child's 100% failure rate in social smiling (across 5 attempts with different adults) is clinically significant, as is the contextual name-response pattern (responds to unfamiliar examiner but not familiar parents - a known red flag). Even in \"successful\" joint attention episodes, the child required multiple prompts (e.g., 11-second latency in tree picture task).]\n\n[<doctor 5> to <doctor 4>: The child's \"typical\" behaviors you note are actually qualitatively atypical. While they pointed to the bird, they did so without smiling or vocalizing (flat affect). Their \"enthusiastic\" sharing at 13:58 occurred only after 11 seconds of staring at the picture first. Neurotypical children typically integrate multiple social signals (smile + point + vocalization) spontaneously. The diagnostic threshold requires \"deficits\" - not absence - of skills, and this child shows clear quantitative reductions in social communication frequency and quality.] \n\n[<doctor 5> to <doctor 3>: The repetitive behavior with the toy car is more significant than you acknowledge - the child persisted with it through 6/9 paradigms, including during highly stimulating events (animations, parent departure). This \"insistence on sameness\" combined with social communication differences meets the two-domain requirement for ASD diagnosis. The lack of observable separation anxiety is irrelevant - DSM-5 removed this as a diagnostic criterion precisely because it's unreliable in clinical settings.]",
