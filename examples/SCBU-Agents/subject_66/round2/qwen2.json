    "content": "1. Reasons for autism spectrum disorder judgment: [The child demonstrates a mix of behaviors that are both typical and atypical. The child shows significant deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, particularly in the lack of social smiling despite making eye contact during multiple Social Smile paradigms. The child also exhibits inconsistent responses to name calling, responding appropriately in one instance but not in others. However, the child does show some typical behaviors, such as making eye contact, pointing to objects, and reacting to the parent leaving the room. The child's ability to engage in joint attention and share findings with the doctor suggests some flexibility and interest in the environment. The mixed presentation of behaviors, with both typical and atypical responses, makes a definitive diagnosis challenging. However, the persistent lack of social smiling and inconsistent response to name calling are significant indicators of potential ASD. Additionally, the child's limited response to sensory stimuli, such as animations and sounds, further supports the consideration of ASD. The clustering of these atypical behaviors across multiple paradigms aligns with the DSM-5 criteria for ASD.]\n\n2. Autism spectrum disorder Judgment results: [1]\n\n3.

While the child does show some typical behaviors, such as making eye contact and engaging in joint attention, these are not consistent across all paradigms.

I believe these behaviors, taken together, suggest a broader pattern consistent with ASD.]\n[<doctor 4> to <doctor 3>: The child's persistent lack of social smiling and inconsistent response to name calling are significant indicators of potential ASD.
