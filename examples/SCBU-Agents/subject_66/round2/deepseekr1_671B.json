    "content": "1. Reasons for autism spectrum disorder judgment: [After carefully reviewing the script and considering the debate, I maintain my ASD diagnosis (1) with additional supporting evidence. The child demonstrates: (1) Marked deficits in social-emotional reciprocity (0/5 social smile responses despite clear eye contact, which suggests atypical affect regulation; 2/3 name response failures with parents vs. 1/1 success with doctor indicates context-dependent social responsiveness), (2) Clear nonverbal communication abnormalities (delayed/absent pointing in 50% of joint attention trials, with successful attempts requiring extended engagement time), (3) Sensory processing differences (ignoring 2/3 sudden audiovisual stimuli despite normal hearing), and (4) Behavioral inflexibility (persistent toy car play across 9/12 paradigms). While some typical behaviors exist, their inconsistency and the clustering of atypical behaviors across multiple domains meet DSM-5 criteria for ASD. The pattern of \"islands of ability\" amidst broader deficits is characteristic of ASD presentations.]\n\n2. Autism spectrum disorder Judgment results: [1]\n\n3. Persuasion: \n[<doctor 5> to <doctor 2>: Your hesitation likely stems from the child's occasional joint attention successes, but consider: (1) The social smile paradigm showed 0/5 responses despite perfect eye contact - this dissociation between eye contact and affective response is pathognomonic for ASD. (2) Name response was context-dependent (failed with parents but succeeded with doctor), suggesting social motivation is tied to specific circumstances rather than being consistently present. (3) The \"typical\" separation response actually showed atypical latency (22.5s delay before reacting), which fits the ASD profile of delayed social-emotional processing.]\n\n[<doctor 5> to <doctor 3>: You note the mix of typical/atypical behaviors, but the diagnostic significance lies in their pattern: (1) All joint attention successes occurred after >5s delay (09:54.750, 15:40.875), showing impaired spontaneous initiation. (2) The child ignored 67% of sudden sensory stimuli (birdsong, cow sounds) despite normal hearing - this sensory filtering is atypical. (3) Your observation about separation anxiety is incorrect; the script clearly shows the child chased the parent persistently (22:45.375), which actually supports my diagnosis as it demonstrates rigid attachment rather than flexible social bonding.]",
