Reasons for autism spectrum disorder judgment: [Upon re-evaluation, considering the mixed behaviors exhibited by the child and the feedback from other experts, it is clear that the child shows a combination of typical and atypical behaviors. The child's lack of social smiling in response to the doctor's and parent's smiles, despite making eye contact, is a significant red flag. The inconsistent response to the name being called, with a normal response only when the doctor called the child's name, suggests potential social communication deficits. The child's focused play on the toy car and limited reaction to sensory stimuli indicate possible restricted and repetitive behaviors. While the child did show some joint attention by pointing to the pictures and sharing findings, these were not consistent across all paradigms. The child's reaction to the parent leaving the room was appropriate, which is a positive sign. However, the overall pattern of behavior, with deficits in social reciprocity and inconsistent responses to social cues, aligns with some criteria for ASD. The child's behavior does not fully meet the criteria for a definitive diagnosis of ASD, but the presence of several ASD-consistent behaviors warrants a cautious approach.]\n\n2. Autism spectrum disorder Judgment results: [0]\n\n3. Persuasion: [<doctor 3> to <doctor 1>: The child's inconsistent response to name calling and the lack of social smiling are concerning, but the child also demonstrated appropriate reactions in certain situations, such as pointing to pictures and showing separation anxiety, which suggests a more nuanced presentation than a definitive ASD diagnosis.] [<doctor 3> to <doctor 2>: I agree with your assessment that the child shows some characteristics consistent with ASD, but not enough for a definitive diagnosis. The child's behavior is indeed mixed, and while there are concerning signs, there are also typical responses that make a definitive ASD diagnosis challenging based on this limited observation.] [<doctor 3> to <doctor 4>: The child's mixed presentation of behaviors, with both typical and atypical responses, makes a definitive diagnosis challenging. However, the persistent lack of social smiling and inconsistent response to name calling are significant indicators that should be considered in future assessments.] [<doctor 3> to <doctor 5>: While the child does show a pattern of atypical behaviors, the presence of some typical behaviors, such as separation anxiety and occasional joint attention, suggests that a definitive diagnosis of ASD may not be warranted based on this single observation. The inconsistency in the child's responses is significant, but it is also important to consider the child's age and the context of the assessment.]"
